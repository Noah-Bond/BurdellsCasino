# BurdellsCasino

For our final LMC 2700 project, our group elected to recreate popular card game Blackjack using HTML/CSS and Javascript. 
The game’s design was agreed upon by all members of the group, and then we worked out a visual design concept for the game and moved to coding. 
The framework of the game was handled largely by Grace, with Greyson and Noah making adjustments as needed. 
May handled much of the visual design for the game, designing the graphics for the cards and backgrounds during the game. 
These were implemented by Greyson, who handled making the game able to be replayable, as well as working on many of the functions within the game itself,
such as the hit or pass functions. 
These also needed to be implemented for the house “player” as well.

Our group attempted to keep the house rules to a minimum. The rules of our game are simple. 
A player’s goal is to have a combined card value (from all of their cards) as close to 21 as possible without going over. 
Jacks, Queens, and Kings are all worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points. 
The initial assignment and adjustment of card values, including changing the ace’s values, was handled by Noah. 
Later adjustments were handled by Greyson to ensure that Aces were able to change values correctly. 
Players will be given one card at the start of the game, and play continues until one player reaches 21 or goes over. 
Players can hit or pass every turn. 
A hit gives them a new card, and passing does not.
